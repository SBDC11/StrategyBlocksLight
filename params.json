This library is being used as the backbone for the IPhone app, and is being actively developed for use in a new HTML5 StrategyBlocks client.\r\n\r\nTo use this library effectively, you will need to [create a StrategyBlocks account](https://app.strategyblocks.com/register.html) if you don't already have one. \r\n\r\nOnce you have an account, check out some of the html files in the /tests folder and see some basic examples for how to use it. There's no documentation yet, but feel free to post any problems/questions under the *issues* section of the repository and I'll get back to you asap. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
