<h2>Welcome to the Homepage for the StrategyBlocks lightweight front-end.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Warning: This library is still a work in progress </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This library is intended to be available for free for anyone who wants to develop their own client for <a href="http://www.strategyblocks.com">StrategyBlocks</a>. This library is being used as the backbone for the IPhone app, and is being actively developed for use in a new HTML5 StrategyBlocks client.</p>

<p>To use this library effectively, you will need to <a href="https://app.strategyblocks.com/register.html">create a StrategyBlocks account</a> if you don't already have one. </p>

<p>Once you have an account, check out some of the html files in the /tests folder and see some basic examples for how to use it. There's no documentation yet, but feel free to post any problems/questions under the <em>issues</em> section of the repository and I'll get back to you asap. </p>
